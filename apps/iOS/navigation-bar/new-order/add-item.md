## Add Item

There are two **Add Item** screens. The first one gives the user the option to either 'Create New Item' or select items from their catalog.

The below screen appears when the user chooses to create a new item. Here, the user inserts the details of the item they want to create and then clicks on save to create the new item which will be later added to their [Catalog](../store/catalog.md).
