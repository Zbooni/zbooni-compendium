## New Order

The app's default Home Page is `NEW ORDER`. From here, the user can create a new order.

Once the user clicks on `Create order`, they will first be redirected to **Customers** screen, where they can either `Add New Customer` or choose from their customer list. The user can either select a customer for the new order or create an empty order by clicking `Skip` and having the customer fill in their information later.

Next, the user will be redirected to the **Add Item** screen where they can either 'Create New Item' or select items from their catalog.
