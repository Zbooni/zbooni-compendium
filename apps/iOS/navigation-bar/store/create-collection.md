## Create collection

The user has the option to group their products into a collection.

In the `Create collection` screen they will insert the **Name of collection** and a **Description**.

![Collections Screen](../../images/screenshots/collections/02.jpg?raw=true "Collections")

Next, they will be redirected to the [Add Item](../new-order/add-item.md), so they can add items to their collection.
